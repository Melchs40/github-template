# weather-app

The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with asynchronous functions. By completing this project, I hope to gain a working knowledge of fetch, try/catch, async/await, among the other functions that I've learned. I will use these to create a weather app that fetches the data from a weather API when the user inputs a location and then displays that information to the user.
